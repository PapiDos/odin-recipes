  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup margarine</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>
      In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.

    <li>
      Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
