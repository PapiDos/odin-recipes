My Odin Recipes Project

This project is a barebone and simple website with a main index page
linking to a few recipes.

The intention of this project is to put in practice 
what I've learned so far in the Fundation course of
The Odin Project.

I will showcase my ability to implement my knowledge in
HTML, Git, GitHub, CLI.

Once I advance in the curriculum I might revisit this
project to improve the UI designe with CSS and maybe
it's functionality with JS.
Your README.md for the "Odin Recipes" project looks good! Here are a few minor suggestions for improvement:

Typo in Project Name: You wrote "READMI.md" instead of "README.md" in the first line. Ensure the file name is correct.

Clarify Project Description: It might be helpful to provide a clearer description of what the website is about. For example, you could mention that it's a collection of recipes or a cooking-related project.

Improve Formatting: The text seems to be cut off in the second paragraph. Make sure the content is complete and formatted properly.

Here's a revised version incorporating these suggestions:
